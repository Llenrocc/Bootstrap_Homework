                    <p>My name is Nathan, and I am a coding student at the University of Toronto, School of Continuing Studies. I have lived in Toronto for almost 10 years. 
                        I first lived on the West End, Dundas & Bloor. From there I moved to Queen & Parliament, and then finally, Midtown, Yonge and Davisville.

                    <p>I was originally born in Guatemala City, Guatemala. The civil war was still going on, and I was reluctantly put up for adoption. I ended up getting adopted shortly after, when I was a year and a half old. My adoptive parents lived in Waterloo, Ontario at the time. We lived there until the end of my 4th grade year, then I switched schools
                    when my parents moved to a small town called "Listowel". It was, ironically, where I started getting really into hip-hop, and where I got my influence to start creating my own music. 
                    <br><br>My parents got me on skates as soon as I could walk, and that's where my love for hockey started. My parents also got me involed in baseball, soccer, golf, and Judo. My dad, being an avid golfer, can't go a weekend without it. The golf course in listowel is beautiful. 
                    When I was younger I played hockey with a guy who is now on the PGA tour, Corey Connors. Another local, Jared Keeso, created the show Letterkenny 4 years ago.<br><br>
                    I have always been the artistic type, when I wasn't playing high school sports, I enjoyed art class, history, drama, biology and geography. My artistic interests took me to film school in Welland, at Niagara College. The main focus was acting, but we also had opportunites to do ADR, Foley, film scene work, film editing, as well as taking part in film student projects.
                    After I graduated from Niagara College, I moved to Toronto to attend Trebas Institute, expanding my knowledge in the film and tv program. <br>
                    As I've gotten older, I have gotten more and more into photography, all the photos used for this project are my mine. I do like to travel, and wish to do more once we are able to. A friend of mine and I were supposed to be going to Morrocco, and then to Portugal in April, but then Covid hit. 
                    I have been to Cuba, Mexico, US, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Guatemala. I was lucky enough to come into contact with my birth family, and I first visited 3 years ago, on Mothers Day. 
                    My mother is no longer with us, but I was able to see my grandmother, who was there when I was adopted. I have 3 aunts, all similar in age. My oldest aunt is 37, then 32, and 31. We all look like siblings in young photos of us.
